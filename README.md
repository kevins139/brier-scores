# Polar forecasts and Brier scores

Imagine your Brier score is currently 0.5 and you've answered 50 questions.
If you set 0% Yes:
-And it resolves as Yes your brier score will decrease to 0.49 (improved by 2%)
-And it resolves as No your brier score will increase to 0.529412 (5.88% worse)
If you set 5% Yes and the question resolves as 'No'
-And it resolves as Yes your brier score will improve to 0.490294 (improved by 1.995%)
-And it resolves as No your brier score will increase to 0.525588(5.12% worse)

i.e. by changing from 5% -> 0% chance, you improve your score by a further 0.005% if you're correct, but damage it by a further 0.76% if wrong.

Below is a chart illustrating the effect visually
